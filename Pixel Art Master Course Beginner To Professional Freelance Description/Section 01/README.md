# Section 01: Getting started.

Getting started.

# What I learned.

# How this course works.

- Difficulty levels:
    - The `B` is for **Beginner**!
    - The `I` is for **Intermediate**!
    - The `A` is for **Advanced**!

- The rule for the practice:
    - The `95%` should be practice! `5%` should be theory!
        - Meaning more **practice** than **theory**!

# 2024 Update (extra info + Aseprite).

- Personally I try to use **Aseprite**!

# What software to use? Free or paid?.
